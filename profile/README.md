## :wave: Hi there, We're Nirmini.
### We make games, Nova, and software.

## What we're working on:
- HSRF (Horizon Scientific Research Facility)
  - HSRF is a Roblox game that makes use of multiple technical demos and innovations to deliver a repeatable and consistent experience no matter the platform.
- Nova
  - Nova is a Discord bot made for communities of all sizes on multiple platforms.
  - Got an idea for [Nova](https://github.com/Nirmini/Novabot)? Let us know!
- Nexus
  - Game Administration and moderation made simple and easy.
- Bot Maker's Toolkit
  - An Electron app for designing and hosting your own Discord and/or Guilded bot the way you want it. 
  - Bot Maker's Toolkit also supports writing your own code, using code blocks, or just using an action list.
